## How I Built It
I developed this web app by leveraging a stack of both front-end and back-end technologies. 
On the front-end, I utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an engaging and visually appealing user interface. HTML was used to structure the content, CSS was employed for styling and layout design, and JavaScript handled the app's logic and functionality.
For the back-end, I integrated the Coffee REST API (https://sampleapis.com/api-list/coffee) to retrieve data and generate tasty recipes based on user input.
